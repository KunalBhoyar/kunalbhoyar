# Kunal Bhoyar

Currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Information Systems** from **Northeastern University, Boston, MA**, I am a skilled **DevOps Engineer** and **Python developer**. With expertise in programming languages, cloud computing, and data engineering, I excel at developing scalable applications and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver impactful solutions.

I am proficient in **Python** and am actively expanding my knowledge in **DevOps** with hands-on experience using **AWS** and **GCP**.

- As a **DevOps Engineer**, I designed and implemented a **Modern Data Stack** process, reducing resource usage by optimizing workflows.
- Previously, as a **Python Product Engineer**, I developed a utilities application that improved server setup efficiency.

I also have extensive experience in managing network infrastructure and automating DevOps practices to improve scalability and efficiency.
